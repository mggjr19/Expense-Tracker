The Expense Tracker is a command-line Python application that allows a user to record and manage personal 
expenses across multiple program runs. The program should let the user add new expenses by entering an amount,
category, date, and optional description, and it should store this information in a structured format so it 
persists after the program exits. Users should be able to view all recorded expenses and see a summary of total
spending, including totals grouped by category. The application should handle invalid input gracefully,
provide a simple text-based menu for navigation, and keep the internal logic organized using functions 
and appropriate data structures to clearly separate user interaction, data processing, and file storage.
